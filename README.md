# Autonomous Magnetic Tracking Smart Car (System Archive)

**Status:** Completed (2022) | **Role:** Team Lead & Control Algorithm Developer

## 1. Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an autonomous vehicle capable of tracking a magnetic wire path. The system utilizes **electromagnetic induction** for path detection and a **PID control algorithm** for precise steering and speed regulation.

## 2. Hardware Architecture [Based on Technical Report]
The system is built on a modular architecture:
* **MCU:** STM32F103C8T6 (ARM Cortex-M3) - The core processing unit.
* **Sensors:** Custom-made Inductor Coils + Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amp). 
    * *Logic:* The Op-Amp converts weak induced electromotive force from the wire into readable analog signals for the MCU's ADC[cite: 797].
* **Actuators:** DC Motors driven by **L298N** Dual H-Bridge module.
* **Power:** 7.4V Li-po battery, regulated to 5V for logic circuits[cite: 796].

## 3. Control Algorithm (PID)
The core challenge was to minimize the steady-steady error during high-speed tracking. [cite_start]I implemented a classic **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)** controller[cite: 807]:

* **Error Signal ($e(t)$):** Calculated from the differential voltage between the left and right inductor coils.
* **Control Output ($u(t)$):**
    $$u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}$$
* **Tuning Strategy:**
    * **P (Proportional):** Adjusted for basic responsiveness.
    * **D (Derivative):** Introduced to predict error trends and eliminate oscillation (overshoot) during sharp turns[cite: 819].
    * **I (Integral):** Used to eliminate steady-state error on straight paths[cite: 814].

## 4. Implementation Details
* [cite_start]**Signal Processing:** The analog signals from the inductors are processed via the on-board ADC (PA1/PA2 pins)[cite: 799].
* [cite_start]**Motor Control:** PWM signals generated by STM32 timers are sent to the L298N driver to control motor speed and direction differentially[cite: 797].
* [cite_start]**Optimization:** Achieved stable tracking at 50% of maximum motor speed through iterative parameter tuning[cite: 792].
